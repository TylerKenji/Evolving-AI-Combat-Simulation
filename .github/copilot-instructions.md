## Project Context
This is an Evolving Battle AI project focusing on:
- Multiple AI agents with different combat strategies
- Genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning for adaptation
- Combat abilities: dodging, attacking, positioning, cooperation
- Environmental factors: terrain, weapons, allies
- Multi-generational evolution and strategy adaptation
