Task 1.4.6 Implementation Summary: Basic Collision Detection

COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY! ✅

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Collision Detection Properties

- Added `collision_radius` property to BaseAgent (default: 10.0)
- Added `collision_events` list to track recent collisions

### 2. Collision Detection Methods

- `check_collision_with_agent(other)` - Agent-to-agent collision detection
- `check_collision_with_point(point, radius)` - Point/object collision detection
- `check_collision_with_bounds(battlefield_bounds)` - Boundary collision detection
- `get_collision_boundary_normal(battlefield_bounds)` - Get boundary collision normal

### 3. Collision Resolution Methods

- `resolve_collision_with_agent(other, separation_force)` - Push overlapping agents apart
- `resolve_boundary_collision(battlefield_bounds)` - Clamp position within bounds
- `get_nearby_agents_for_collision(all_agents, check_radius)` - Get collision candidates

### 4. Collision State Management

- `update_collision_state(dt, all_agents, battlefield_bounds)` - Main collision update
- `has_recent_collision(collision_type, time_window)` - Check for recent collisions
- Collision event recording with timestamps and metadata

### 5. Serialization Integration

- Added collision_radius and collision_events to agent serialization
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing serialization

## Key Features

✅ **Circular Collision Detection**: Uses distance-based collision with configurable radius
✅ **Boundary Enforcement**: Prevents agents from leaving battlefield bounds  
✅ **Collision Resolution**: Automatically separates overlapping agents
✅ **Event Recording**: Tracks collision history for behavior analysis
✅ **Performance Optimized**: Only checks nearby agents for collision
✅ **Status Effect Integration**: Respects stun status when resolving collisions
✅ **Flexible Design**: Works with any Vector2D-based objects

## Testing Results

✅ All 297 existing tests still pass (no regressions)
✅ Agent-agent collision detection working correctly
✅ Boundary collision detection working correctly  
✅ Collision resolution prevents overlap
✅ Boundary normal calculation accurate
✅ Collision event recording functional
✅ Point collision detection operational
✅ Serialization includes collision properties

## Integration Notes

- Environment-level collision detection already existed in SimpleEnvironment
- Agent-level collision detection now provides fine-grained control
- Agents can now handle their own collision responses
- Supports both reactive (after collision) and predictive collision handling
- Compatible with existing movement, combat, and status effect systems

## Next Steps

Task 1.4.6 is complete! Ready to proceed to:

- Task 1.4.7: Add debug information and logging
- Task 1.5.x: Concrete agent implementations (RandomAgent, IdleAgent, etc.)

The collision detection system provides a solid foundation for more advanced
behaviors like collision avoidance, formation movement, and tactical positioning.
