# Evolving Battle AI Project

## Overview

This project aims to create an evolving battle AI system featuring multiple AI agents that adapt their combat strategies over generations using genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning.

## Features

- **Adaptive AI Agents**: Multiple agent types with evolving strategies
- **Genetic Evolution**: Agents improve over generations through genetic algorithms
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Real-time learning and adaptation
- **Complex Combat**: Dodging, attacking, positioning, and cooperation mechanics
- **Environmental Factors**: Terrain effects, weapon systems, and team dynamics
- **Emergent Behavior**: Unexpected strategies and counter-strategies develop naturally

## Development Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Foundation & Architecture (Weeks 1-3)
2. **Phase 2**: Basic Combat System (Weeks 4-6)
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced Behaviors & Learning (Weeks 7-10)
4. **Phase 4**: Cooperation & Team Dynamics (Weeks 11-13)
5. **Phase 5**: Weapon Systems & Specialization (Weeks 14-16)
6. **Phase 6**: Advanced Evolution & Emergent Behavior (Weeks 17-20)
7. **Phase 7**: Analysis & Optimization (Weeks 21-24)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed with "Add to PATH" checked
- Git (for version control)

### Setup Development Environment

1. **Download Python**: Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not already installed
2. **Run setup script**: Double-click `setup_env.bat` or run in terminal
3. **Verify installation**: 
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   pytest tests/
   ```

See `DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.

### Current Status: Phase 1 Foundation Ready ✅

- ✅ Project structure created
- ✅ Core utilities implemented (Vector2D, Configuration)
- ✅ Testing framework setup
- ✅ Development environment ready

**Next**: Continue with Task 1.2.1 from `TASK_BREAKDOWN.md`

## Key Technologies

- **Primary Language**: Python (recommended)
- **ML Frameworks**: TensorFlow or PyTorch
- **Visualization**: Pygame, matplotlib, or web-based dashboard
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Custom implementation or DEAP library
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Stable-baselines3 or custom implementation

## Goals

- Create AI agents that demonstrate emergent tactical behaviors
- Test adaptive combat strategies through evolutionary pressure
- Develop sophisticated multi-agent cooperation systems
- Analyze evolution of strategy and counter-strategy development
- Build foundation for advanced AI research applications

## Documentation

The main strategy document (`BATTLE_AI_STRATEGY.md`) contains:
- Detailed phase-by-phase development plan
- Technical architecture recommendations
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Success metrics and evaluation criteria
- Future extension possibilities

## Contributing

This project is currently in the planning phase. Once implementation begins, contribution guidelines will be established.
