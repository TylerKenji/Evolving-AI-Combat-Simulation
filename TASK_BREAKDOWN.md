**Completed**: August 31, 2025  
**Implementation Highlights**:

- **Completely Passive Agent Class**: Full concrete implementation of BaseAgent interface with zero activity behavior
- **Perfect Predictability**:
  - Always returns CombatAction.MOVE with zero velocity (no movement)
  - Never selects targets (always returns None)
  - Never takes any actions beyond required status effect updates
  - Provides 100% consistent and predictable behavior
- **Testing and Validation Features**:
  - Idle statistics tracking (total idle time, update count, average intervals)
  - Comprehensive logging integration with debug system from Task 1.4.7
  - Minimal computational overhead - ideal for performance baselines
  - Role customization support (Tank, DPS, Support, Balanced)
- **Quality Assurance**:
  - Complete test suite with 11 comprehensive test cases covering all functionality
  - Behavioral consistency validation ensuring zero variation
  - Damage handling verification (remains passive even when attacked)
  - String representations and strategy descriptions
  - Demo script showcasing contrast with RandomAgent behavior
- **Use Case Optimization**:
  - Testing dummy for target practice and damage validation
  - Performance baseline for measuring other agents' activity
  - Simulation placeholder for incomplete AI implementations
  - Population padding without affecting simulation dynamics

**Technical Achievement**: Created the essential passive agent that serves as the perfect control element for testing and validation. The IdleAgent provides a predictable, zero-activity baseline that enables systematic measurement of other agents' behaviors and serves as an invaluable tool for AI development and system validation.
